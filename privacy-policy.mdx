# Privacy policy

**Last Updated:** December 20, 2025

Parcel Tracer provides a logistics platform composed of two primary components:

- **Parcel Tracer Mobile App** – used by delivery drivers to manage and confirm deliveries, and by merchants to place and track orders.
- **Parcel Tracer Web App** – used by delivery companies and merchants to manage orders and track deliveries.

This Privacy Policy describes how Parcel Tracer collects, uses, and protects information across both platforms.

---

## 1. Data We Process

### A. Mobile App

#### I. Drivers

Parcel Tracer mobile app does **not collect personal information directly** from drivers. All accounts are created by the delivery company admin via the web platform.

**Data processed:**

- **Phone Number** – used only for login (assigned by the delivery company).
- **Location Data (On-Duty Only)** – Real-time GPS location is collected **only when the driver is marked as "on duty"**. This data is used to:
  - Track delivery and pickup routes
  - Provide accurate delivery time estimates to customers
  - Ensure driver accountability and safety
  - Optimize logistics operations
  - Provide proof of delivery locations
  
  **Background Location:** Location tracking continues in the background while on duty, even when the app is not actively in use. This ensures continuous route tracking during deliveries.
  
  **User Control:** Drivers have full control over location tracking via the "on duty" toggle switch. Location tracking **immediately stops** when the driver goes "off duty".
  
  **Data Retention:** Historical location data is retained for **90 days** for operational, safety, and compliance purposes, after which it is automatically deleted.

- **Order & Invoice Data** – used to display and update delivery statuses.
- **QR Code Scans** – used to confirm delivery.
- **Device Info** (non-personal) – may be used for diagnostics.

#### II. Merchants

Parcel Tracer mobile app does **not collect personal information directly** from merchants. All accounts are created by the delivery company admin via the web platform.

**Data processed:**

- **Phone Number** – used only for login with an OTP auth code.
- **Order & Invoice Data** – used to display and update delivery statuses.
- **Device Info** (non-personal) – may be used for diagnostics.

### B. Web App (Admin & Merchant-Facing)

Used by delivery companies and merchants to manage logistics.

**Data collected:**

- **User Account Info** – name, phone number, and role (admin, merchant, driver).
- **Order Details** – source address, destination address, customer name and phone number.
- **Address Processing** – district and city may be detected using OpenAI LLM for delivery improvement.
- **Invoices and Logs** – for operational and reporting purposes.

## 2. How We Use the Information

Parcel Tracer uses collected data to:

- Authenticate users via their assigned phone numbers.
- **Track driver locations in real-time during active delivery operations** (drivers only, when on duty).
- Manage orders, track deliveries, and send alerts.
- **Ensure driver safety and provide emergency response capabilities**.
- **Optimize delivery routes and improve operational efficiency**.
- Improve address accuracy using AI-assisted detection.
- Maintain records for invoicing and analytics.
- Protect the security and integrity of the system.

**We do not sell or share personal information** with advertisers or unrelated third parties.

### Location Data Sharing

Driver location data may be visible to:
- Delivery company dispatchers and administrators
- Merchants (for their orders only)
- Customers (limited to real-time delivery tracking)

This information is **only shared during active delivery operations** when the driver is on duty.

---

## 3. Data Storage & Retention

- Data is stored securely in cloud infrastructure.
- **General data** is retained **for as long as required by the delivery company**.
- **Location data** is automatically deleted after **90 days** unless required for legal or regulatory reasons.
- Data can be deleted on request by the delivery company admin.

---

## 4. User Account Management

- **All accounts are created by the delivery company admin.**
- End users (drivers, merchants) **cannot self-register**.
- Login is done via phone number provided by the company.

---

## 5. Use of Third-Party Services

Parcel Tracer uses **OpenAI's language model API** to help detect cities and districts in customer addresses. These requests are:

- Processed in real-time.
- Not stored or reused by OpenAI (per their API data usage policy).
- Used only to enhance delivery accuracy.

No other third-party services are used for tracking, analytics, or profiling.

---

## 6. Security

We take data protection seriously and apply safeguards such as:

- HTTPS encryption
- Role-based access controls
- Secure authentication
- Monitoring and audit logging
- Secure location data transmission and storage

---

## 7. Your Rights

- Delivery companies can request data deletion or export at any time.
- Users should contact their admin to request changes or deletions.
- Drivers can control when location tracking occurs via the "on duty" toggle.
